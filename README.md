# A simple step by step Runs of Homozygosity analysis guide
## Introduction
Runs Of Homozygosity or ROH are uninterrupted homozygous regions of the genome. They appear when two copies of an ancestral haplotype are joined in an individual. Short ROH indicate distant inbreeding, while long ROH indicate recent inbreeding. This guide will help you estimate overall homozygosity in a population using highthrouput genotyping data.
